### Spot the type of solution:
* Dynamic Programming: Subproblem method of approach possible - possible overlapping sub problems occurence - Dynamic Progamming it is!
 - Recursive and Memoized (TopDown) - break into subproblems to solve to a solution
 - Start from subproblems and move to a solution (BottomUp)
